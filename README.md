# Dungeon Crawler
This dungeon crawler game is made with Qt and C++ in the lab of the "Programming 2" course at [h_da](https://h-da.de/).
The excersices were given by [Prof. Benjamin Meyer](fbi.h-da.de/personen/benjamin-meyer) and [Michael Roth](fbi.h-da.de/personen/michael-roth).

## Credits
* JSON import handled via [JSON for modern C++](github.com/nlohmann/json)
* Dejkstra algorithm based on the implementation of [Prof. Stefan Rapp](fbi.h-da.de/personen/stefan-rapp) ("AuD" course winterterm 21/22)

## Last words
Keep in mind that his project was created some years ago. At this time writing an application this size and complexity felt like a great success for me!
